# omega_garage

A node js application that can control your garage door(s).

This app uses a configuration file to define pins, the name of the garage door that the pin corresponds with, and a sensor pin for the magnetic proximity sensor.

Mainly designed for use with two wire garage door openers. I have found that some Chamberlain 2 wire systems do not work with just a relay. The systems have something called Security+ 2.0 which uses a serial wire protocol. I have yet had time to decrypt this so be aware this doesn't work with every 2 wire system.

* There are a few more dependencies now that email notifications are enabled.

 * Express js

 * emailjs and its dependencies

 * You must get a copy of express for node. Follow the instructions in the guide here: https://community.onion.io/topic/855/nodejs-express-http-server/2. I have included a version in the repo that is working for me.
